    "contents": "\nAs a Data Scientist, exploring datasets is a daily occurrence. Finding the right dataset is the first step when wanting to start a project. Unfortunately, this is one of the more difficult tasks for me.\nI am a very curious person and I tend to get interested in different topics very easily. One thing that is a must for me, when looking at different datasets, is that they need to be interesting to me (which is a given). I tend to get bored of a project if Iâ€™m not passionate on knowing the results.\nI wanted to work on a dataset that would keep me intrigued. Unfortunately, this was anything but a linear process. I started off with a dataset that had a few columns: Location, Year, Probability (%) of dying from cancer between age 30 and 70, and gender. I was originally interested in this as I thought there could be some interesting insights. Although I do find it interesting, I don’t think there is enough significant information for a multiple week project. There could be a few interesting visualizations, but that’s it. That was not what I was looking for, I needed something that was more complex.\nThe second dataset that I started to look at was leaning towards Machine Learning, which I am very interested in. Given a certain amount of information, a company wanted to know the probability of an employee staying with their company long term. More specifically, the company only wants to invest in training materials for those who plan on staying even after the training. They have found that there are too many employees who receive the training, but then leave for a different job. This training costs the company money, so being able to predict who will stay would be valuable.\nI started on this project and what I struggled with was finding the target dataset. I ended up finding it seperate from the actual dataset files, which I found odd. By the time I had looked into everything, I lost interest in the project completely. The project, again, seemed to not have what I was looking for. I also found the description of the project very confusing and poorly worded.\nThe third dataset that I came across was more interesting to me. It was a dataset that I found on Kaggle that had bank information as data. The bank, given all the historical data, wanted to know which customers were going to leave their accounts. If the bank was notified who would be leaving, they could easily reach out and make accomodations.\nThis dataset was intriguing because I wanted to know who was going to leave their accounts. I knew that there would be enough complexity to this dataset, that I could do weeks worth of work and use different Machine Learning alogrithms. I thought it would be interesting to use different algorithms and get different accuracies for them. Comparing the algorithms and which would be best to use is very interesting to me.\nSo, of course it’s important to stick with a dataset and find insights. It’s also equally important to enjoy the project you are working on. The project will be a lot easier if you are passionate about it.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nSelling Yourself to an Employer\nData Science can be applied to any field, having a variety of different skills. This ends up creating a vague name for Data Scientist to mean anyone who can code and understand the way data works.\nHowever, that description is too vague to ever get a career. I’ve noticed that when I look at job postings, every data science job is so different. The skills that are required, the software they use, their own beliefs in which languages should be used, etc. It’s almost impossible to be just a Data Scientist, because that doesn’t really mean anything. A lot of experts could be considered Data Scientists with such a vague definition. So, it’s your job to understand your own skills and how to sell an employer on them.\nUnderstanding your own skills\nMany people out there could say that are very familiar with Python and R or even web design, but saying it like that, puts you in the same pool as 95% other “Data Scientists”.\nInstead, you need to know exactly what you do know about certain languages and what you don’t know. Understanding R is great, but being as specific as saying what type of coding you do and certain libraries that you are familiar with is essential to state.\nApply Your Skills When you can define for yourself exactly what you can do, you then need to know how to apply your skills to any employer. They are interviewing you because they’re curious to see how your skills could impact their company. They’re not always looking for a perfect fit, but they’re wanting the job to be done as efficient or more efficient than how it currently is. You should also be just as curious about them as they are about you.\nYou need to find out if your skills will help their company or if you would be better finding a different job where you know you would be appreciated.\nSo, How Do I Prepare Myself? We have already talked about understanding your own skills and how to apply them to a job opening, but you also need to be well prepared with understanding the company. That is one of the biggest mistakes that individuals make. They don’t know enough about the structure of the company they are wanting to work for.\nResearching for hours is necessary. Using LinkedIn to your full advantage is necessary. Understanding the position they are trying to sell to you is just as important as you trying to sell yourself. Expect them to ask the question “What do you know about our company” and be prepared to answer with detail.\n\n\n\n",
